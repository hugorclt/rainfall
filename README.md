# Rainfall Project

## Overview
The Rainfall project is a series of challenges designed to test and improve your cybersecurity skills. Each level presents a unique set of challenges that require you to analyze, exploit, and solve various vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

## Project Structures
The repository follows a specific structure to organize the challenges and associated resources:

Each level directory contains the following:

- **flag**: A file containing the flag or solution for the level.
- **source**: The source code of the exploited binary.
- **walkthrough**: Detailed steps and explanations of the solution.

Additionally, each level may include a `Ressources` directory to store relevant resources for solving the challenges.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rainfall.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired level directory (e.g., `level0`).
3. Read the instructions provided in the `walkthrough` file.
4. Analyze the provided source code in the `source` file.
5. Solve the challenge by following the steps outlined in the `walkthrough`.
6. Store any additional resources or notes in the `Ressources` directory.
